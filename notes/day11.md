This one almost destroyed me. I started with some very naive solutions that used simple caching. I used LLMs pretty extensively to discuss and did figure out most of canonicalization, but I then spent many hours missing that fact that I needed to add to cache upon finding states, rather than processing each state. A lesson I will not forget so soon... There were no similar elixir solutions online, which didn't help. I had some help from some ruby and python solutions. This one hurt...
