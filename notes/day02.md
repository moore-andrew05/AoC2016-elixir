## Problem Thoughts
Again conceptually very easy, not a problem I have to think abou in a language I know.

## Elixir Thoughts
A lot of improvement in this problem compared to day 01. Felt much more comfortable with the syntax of reduce and map and generally how the syntax of elixir works. Much improved use of the |> from part1 to part2. Something to think about is how best to compose functions. For example, here I have two transformation helpers based on the part of the problem (these could be easily combined but that's not the point). Currently, I pass the transformation helper as a parameter to my helper which reduces each row, not sure if this is proper.
